## The assignment

![](https://api.chucknorris.io/img/chucknorris_logo_coloured_small.png)

The applicant should design and implement a minimalistic web-application that would let the user browse, search and navigate through [Chuck Norris jokes](https://api.chucknorris.io/) and works within a standard modern web-browser.
We expect the applicant to at least implement these three endpoints:

- https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/categories
- https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}
- https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/search?query={query}

which would allow:

- listing all the categories
- navigating into a category and showing a random joke in that category.
- searching through all the jokes using free text search.

## Technical assumptions

- You should use PHP as the main backend language and Laravel as the framework.
- You should use Vue as the main frontend framework or Vanilla Javascript if you prefer it.
- You can be creative with the design and layout of your solution.

## Extras

Focus on the basics and on solving the main problem, but you can also:

- Use any third-party library you want (with the exception of jQuery and jQuery-dependent stuff).
- Use modern JavaScript features in your `.js` code.
- Test everything that makes sense to be tested.

## What are we evaluating?

1. The described features and requirements.
2. Any extras you've added to your final solution.
3. Any other creative thing or feature you added by yourself.
4. In general: simplicity, clarity of your solution, architecture, documentation, code style, interface design, and the code.

## Tips

- We want you to show us how you work, break down bigger problems and prioritize them.
- It's an option to not implement everything, mock anything you think it's gonna save you time.
- It's better if you show us something small that works and is well factored rather than something complete but "buggy"
- It's better if you use open-source libraries and explain why you chose them.
- If you have any questions, please ask us :)
